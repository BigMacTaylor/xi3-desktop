## Main goals

• low resource usage (for use on older machines)

• easy for beginners to use

• able to be controlled completely with either the mouse or keyboard

• every window action (opening apps, switching desktops) should be one shortcut away


WARNING! this is still in testing. use at your own risk. :-)
