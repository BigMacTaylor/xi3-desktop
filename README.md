# xi3-desktop

Xi3 is a hobby project, with the goal of creating the most efficient workflow possible.

Based off the i3 window manager, it aims to combine the benefits of a tiling window manager, with the ease of use of a traditional desktop environment.

It's designed to use a hybrid input method, 
Left-hand keyboard, Right-hand mouse. (for normal handed people)

But can be controlled completely with either the mouse or keyboard.
